    <div class="panel-heading">Dividends</div>
    <div class="panel-body"><center>One major way to earn money in stocks is through dividends. Dividends are annual pays that are given to you from companies as a reward for keeping the company's stock at a high price in order for the investors to reap the benefits of their capital. Keep in mind not all companies are generous to give dividends, although it is a great way to receive money through stocks. Some examples of companies that provide dividends to the HR and employees are Microsoft, Johnson and Johnson, and Nestle.

    <div class="panel-heading">Constructing your Portfolio</div>
    <div class="panel-body"><center>When starting out in the field of investment one thing defines an individual's overall aptitude in the market, a portfolio. A stock portfolio consists of your personal investments and assets in the market. In the investing world there are many opportunities, the most prevalent being the stock market. For a portfolio you want to invest in multiple low risk stocks, low risk meaning a low and steady price fluctuation rate. A good stock to invest in would be something that rises steadily and has a good track record, or what investors would call low volatility.  A smart choice would be large corporations that are easily recognizable like apple or google. One example of a good beginner stock would be Apple.


Apple Stock:
Has a good rate of return
Has been increasing steadily since its launch
Has company longevity (has been around since 1985)
Low volatility stock


 
Another portfolio expanding tool would be “hard assets”. Hard assets are possessions of “stand-alone” value that can help protect investors against inflation or a faltering economy. Hard assets are essentially shields against large unpredictable fluctuations. Hard assets will also always have some value, even with market crashes. Examples of hard assets would be gold,silver,oil, and other precious materials.


Precious metals are hard assets known as commodities.
They are not used as a primary investing option, but as a backup to secure a stable net worth.
Should make up 5-8% of your portfolio.



All stocks fluctuate up and down and most will have an upwards curve, however eventually a stock will undergo a crash. A crash is when a stock suddenly decreases in value, typically by a large amount resulting in a loss of profit. Crashes have occurred many times throughout history and have produced catastrophic results for investors.

	
A recession is a period of economic decline where all stocks and values decrease, and then increase just to fall back again.
A recession is incredibly dangerous for investors, because some companies may not recover and be forced into bankruptcy.
This graph is a display of the 1980’s recession which saw assets valued at hundreds of millions of dollars lost.
Recessions
Speculations of a recession have been rushing throughout the whole market from January of this year as hard assets such as oil have been put into a correction of their lowest price levels. As shown from the recession graph, the probability of having a recession in the next four years is near 100% as the market can only go at a steady growth rate till it would completely collapse. Although prices were able to recover for the oil industry cyclical forces are most likely to transfer the economy into a recession in the near future. If job and credit growth are occurring in the economy it is a strong sign that a recession is unlikely to occur at the time.

    <div class="panel-heading">Beginner's guide</div>
    <div class="panel-body"><center>Stocks, the fundamental base of an investor's portfolio. Stocks will help you protect and ensure a stable income and allow you to grow your the capital, or money, you already have. Everyone begins to learn at some point, and when you decide to make the decision to go into stock trading you can use these tips and tricks to increase your profits and secure financial gains.
When investing make sure to allocate funds into companies and things you think or know will still be around in the next few decades.( invest in something with a decent lifetime / longevity)
 Try to invest stocks more in ETF funds. An ETF(exchange-traded fund) is a collection of stocks. For example if you want to go into a real estate stock, you can invest in a bunch of companies as you are investing in all of the real estate market. 
As a beginner is strongly recommended not to invest in tech companies. Because technological trends fluctuate heavily and on short notice. 
Speculations are essentially stocks without a dividend and are not companies you would want to invest in. These are very short term investments.These have a high risk but can potentially yield the most profit ( although it can pay off it is heavily advised to stay away from these types of stock)
Investing companies with dividends let you reap further benefits for investing money into their company. For example a company in which you bought a $100 stock and receive a 4% dividend per year you would be receiving an extra $4. 
If you were to reinvest your dividends, you would be receiving compound interest in the total number of companies you invested in.
You, most of all want to invest in a company that has a steady growth and a long track record of success, investing in a company with fast growth is risky because it can also suffer vast losses.
Re-investing in capital gains will be very beneficial in the long run rather than buying a car.
Overall, investing can definitely be a challenge for a beginner but with the right advice and attitude anyone can’t quickly become a master investor and secure a future for them and their families for generations to come.
